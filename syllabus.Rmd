<br> 
Linguistic semantics is the study of meaning as conveyed via language.It is also the key to the nature of communication, and one of the most challenging parts of current AI-NLP related research. This course is designed for advanced graduate linguistic students, which focuses on the computational treatments of meaning-related topics. Topics covered will be mainly on the formal representations from different perspectives, as well as their computational implementations. By the end of this course, you should be able to apply and evaluate computational methods in semantic studies.

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin" aria-hidden="true"></span> Missed Tests or Assignments

- If a test or tutorial work is missed for a valid medical reason, you must submit the University Verification of [Student Illness or Injury form]() within one week. Submit the form to instructors if it is related to the test. The form will only be accepted as valid if the form is filled out according to the instructions on the form.

- The late penalties for submitting a completed assignment are: 10% if the assignment is submitted within 24 hours of the due date; 30% if the assignment is submitted within 48 hours of the due date; and 100% if the assignment is submitted after 48 hours.

- Other reasons for missing an assignment, tutorial work, or the project presentation will require prior approval by your instructors. If prior approval is not received for non-medical reasons then you will receive a grade of zero for the missed assignment, tutorial work, or test.
